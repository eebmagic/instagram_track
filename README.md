# instagram_track
Instagram doesn't have any easy way that I could find to track your number of followers and people you're following over time so I made this web-srcaping script.
A python script that tracks an account's followers, following, and post counts. 
Ideally this is running on a regular schedule for provide even data points. 
Paste a url into the URL.txt file to check that account.

The current URL.txt file and pastData.json file are examples with my own Insta account.
